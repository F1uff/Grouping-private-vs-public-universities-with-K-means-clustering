# Grouping private vs public universities with K means clustering

This notebook explores the college datset that is available from the Introduction to Statistical Learning book's website.

Here we looked at whether K means clustering might be able to create two clusters of the dataset, corresponding to private vs public universities. 

The datset is labelled in this respect so we dropped the 'Private' feature for the purposes of creating  the model and then used this label to see whether the clusters formed roughly divided the datset in a similar way that the Private vs Public feature does.
